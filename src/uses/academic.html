        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          Why make it hard for yourself and your students to talk with you over the Internet? Why ask students to use a social network to talk with you? What if they don&apos;t want to use a social network? What about their privacy?
        </p>

        <p>
          Don&apos;t you want your help available at times you choose rather than each time you turn an instant messenger on?
        </p>

        <div class="blue-gray-heading">Available When You&apos;re Available</div>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          Cavy comes to the rescue with one-on-one chat (instant messenger) that lets people know when other people will be available.
        </p>

        <p>
          With a topic for everything, Cavy has a <strong>wiki editor</strong>, <strong>wiki searcher</strong> (search) <strong>private instant messenger</strong> (chat), <strong>issue tracker</strong> (issues) &amp; <strong>notification system</strong> (change alerts). This provides students with the information they need and the help they can request.
        </p>

        <p>
          Best of all, you set your availability in your <strong>availability planner</strong>, and so can the students. <strong>One place for everything</strong>, and unlike many social networks, your conversations aren&apos;t used for advertising purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cavy offers a great solution. Will you care enough to try it out?
