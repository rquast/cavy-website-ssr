          </div>
          <div class="ways-paragraph">
            As a person who helps people online, you might be spending an enormous amount of time and money finding a simple <strong>support platform</strong> or <strong>help desk</strong> system that&apos;s easy to work with.

            You&apos;ll likely know the pain of performing simple support tasks and keeping on top of things.

            To be efficient at support, you need many systems to help. A customer relationship manager for customer conversations and reminders, a customer portal, a file sharing system, a world time planner, a documentation system, an issue tracking system, a live chat system.

            How many of these things work efficiently together with little setup needed?

            How often do your users get ignored because there are too many things you need to remember and do each day?

            How often does your documentation remain unfinished or out of date?

            Why does it need to cost so much, take so long to learn, and become so hard to use all of these things together?

            Wouldn&apos;t you like to <strong>stop the interruptions</strong> so you can get on with your work?

          <div class="ways-paragraph">
            Everything is much more simple when you know where things are. That&apos;s why all aspects of support in Cavy are linked together by <strong>context</strong> (topics) in a single, interconnected system.

            There&apos;s no need to understand or search for where something belongs, because everything is grouped by topic and links to other topics. That&apos;s how we think!<br><br>

            Suddenly, everything can be found where it belongs.

              I spent a lot of time in the past writing help and working with different help programs. It took a lot for me to figure out what to write because I wasn&apos;t the person who answered the emails. With Cavy, I can look at customer chats and issues and know what needs to be written. I can also be assigned an issue if something needs writing. It&apos;s fantastic!
